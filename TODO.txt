- initialize site by setting ivars directly, not by passing params to super's initialize()

- create alternate sites (beta, final, etc.) by subclassing site, and changing @output or @location

- create bin/mill tool to replace Rake

- formalize widget creation & access
    - object that is used across site
    - possibly with different states or parameters (eg, navigation)
    - built from current html_fragment use
    - eg:
        - navigation
        - buy buttons
        - link to resource (<a ...>)
        - sidebars

- split Resource#date into Resource#published & Resource#updated
    + add <published> element to feed
    + #published should be stated date (e.g., from header)
    + #updated should be mtime of source file

- make Navigator into more generic Collection
    + include Enumerable

- make Resource::External for external links?
    + add on import of HTML (by examining href/src/etc attributes)

- rationalize resource URI usage
    + #shorten_uris should only apply to writing final files.
    + In original content/etc., URIs should be more flexible.
    + A #convert_uris method should convert all references to proper type.

- save compressed versions of files
    - write compressed versions along with non-compressed
    - serve compressed versions if asked by client

- add MailChimp signup form generator to HTMLHelpers
