- update initializer to keyword style

- move XML validation into checker
    - guess type for mapping to schema

- move import/load/build/save logic into Builder

- formalize widget creation & access
    - object that is used across site
    - possibly with different states or parameters (eg, navigation)
    - built from current html_fragment use
    - eg:
        - navigation
        - buy buttons
        - link to resource (<a ...>)
        - sidebars

- split Resource#date into Resource#published & Resource#updated
    + add <published> element to feed
    + #published should be stated date (e.g., from header)
    + #updated should be mtime of source file

- refactor MIME type usage
    + allow specified type as regexp or glob (use File.fnmatch?)
    + convert to MIME::Type object(s)

- make Navigator into more generic Collection
    + include Enumerable

- make Resource::External for external links?
    + add on import of HTML (by examining href/src/etc attributes)

- Rationalize resource URI usage:
    + #shorten_uris should only apply to writing final files.
    + In original content/etc., URIs should be more flexible.
    + A #convert_uris method should convert all references to proper type.
